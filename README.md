# 4D Explorer

#### _A showcase of 4D geometry by Rane Fields_

## Description

This application is intended to be an immersive, interactive tool that allows users to explore the properties of 4-dimensional Euclidean space. They will learn about different types of projections and how a 4D object can cast a "shadow" into our 3D world, have a chance to interact with 4D solids and get an intuition for how they behave, and even have a chance to move through and explore 4D space themselves.
